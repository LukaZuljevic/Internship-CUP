## üì¶ Installation and Running
> **Note**: Docker is recommended but optional. If you already have PostgreSQL installed locally, you can manually create a database and skip Docker.

To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:
1. **Visual Studio Code** (recommended)
2. **Yarn**
3. **Node.js**
4. **Docker** (or PostgreSQL via pgAdmin)

Steps to Install the Project:
1. **Clone and open the Repository**:
   Open a terminal and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ivonaaaa/internship-cup.git
   cd internship-cup
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   Once you're in the VS Code, open a terminal and type in this command in root directory:    
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start Docker:**
   If you don't have a local PorstgreSQL setup:    
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   - Alternatively, open pgAdmin and create a new database named "bayobey-app". Take note of your connection credentials as you will use this in your .env file as DATABASE_URL.
   
   
4. **Set up the environment variables:**
   
   Create a .env file in the /backend directory:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://pomorac:more123@localhost:5432/bayobey-app"
   JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_here"
   ```
   Create a .env file in the /frontend directory:
   ```bash
   VITE_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoienVsamExMjMiLCJhIjoiY21hYjhyeTVrMXZ1azJsc2RjMGYxNm93OCJ9.2OyzlK3a8dViX2VAAWlqSA

   ```

6. **Setup Database**:
   ```bash
   yarn db:generate
   yarn db:migrate
   yarn db:seed
   ```

7. **Start the application**:
   Use Turborepo to start both workspaces:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   Open in Browser:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend: http://localhost:3000/api
   - Swagger Documentation: http://localhost:3000/api/docs
